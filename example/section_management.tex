  \item Managed the development of the Audience Measurement and reporting System
    (AMS) to capture customer viewership and behavioral metrics allowing DIRECTV
    to monetize and target commercials. Prior to the launch of AMS, DIRECTV had
    no capability to collect metrics from the DVR\@,

    changes to the DIRECTV the software development process. Initiatives now
    start with a white paper describing the proposed feature and impact to
