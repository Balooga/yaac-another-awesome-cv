\par{ Helping projects succeed by learning new technologies while coming up with
  novel solutions to integration and production problems. }

\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed and managed the roll-out of the feature that significantly
    reduced the number of follow up truck rolls (at a cost of \$700 per roll),
    to new customers to fix broken or incomplete installations, thereby
    increasing new customer satisfaction and substantially reducing the cost of
    acquiring new customers,
  \item Designed the feature that allows the DVR to record live events in their
    entirety. Live events have the tendency to start early or run long. Prior to
    this feature the DVR would end the recording at the published end-time,
    usually missing the end of the event,
  \item Designed the feature that allows the DVR to find and record alternate
    showings of live events in the situation that the event booked is
    unavailable due to schedule or access rights issues,
  \item Designed the AuthN and AuthZ (Authentication and Authorization)
    microservices for the AT\&T TV service,
  \item Created a DSL to greatly shorten the development and test cycles when
    migrating between the set-top box middleware of different vendors,
  \item Implemented the logic in C++ in the DIRECTV DVR to manage the UI, video,
    and interactive application layers for 4:3, 16:9 aspect ratios,
  \item Defined RESTful APIs for back-end services,
  \item Responsible for creating the Google Protocol Buffer definitions for gRPC
    services in a microservice architecture, ensuring the capabilities provided
    by these services support the product requirements, and reviewing these APIs
    with engineers,
  \item Created software engineering best practices for the AT\&T back-end
    development teams. As an example, improved the up-time of a production
    system from less than 24-hours to an up-time of over a week by instituting
    guidelines encouraging developers to drive down the number of ignored
    compiler warnings in production code,
  \item Performed code reviews,
  \item Responsible for defining and organizing the thousands of engineering
    requirements for the DIRECTV DVR\@,
  \item Designed a hybrid satellite \& terrestrial delivery system to ingest and
    distribute titles to movie theaters across the US and Canada, with the goal
    of reducing the cost of hard drive deliveries,
  \item Specified a system for the ingestion, association of distribution of
    program and event metadata for movies and TV shows --- to meet the needs of
    the product team attempting to enter a new market segment,
  \item Designed the enterprise logging, monitoring, and alerting platform that
    reduced delays in detection of errors and failures in production workflows
    from days to hours,
  \item Created prototypes for iTV stock trading and horse betting applications,
  \item Implemented a proof of concept opportunistic data encapsulator/data pump
    to evaluate the Optibase MediaPump multiplexer cards,
  \item Design and specified of the Rainbow content delivery network connecting
    the main NOC to 14 remote satellite uplink sites for distribution of live TV
    channels,
  \item Responsible for the analysis, specification and design of a data
    broadcasting and interactive TV (iTV) infrastructure. This included
    scheduling and automation for data delivery, application servers, data
    injectors and the subscriber callback infrastructure.
